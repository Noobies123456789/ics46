# ics46

A repository of my projects from the course iCS46 in University of California-Irvine. Each project is written in the C++ language. 
Project 1 is a project where I use a algorithm to create a maze with given height and width and another algorithm to solve the maze of any kind.
Project 2 is a study of queues and doublylinked lists.
Project 3 is a project where I crate an AI that can play the game Othello.
Project 4 is a project where I use an algorithm that can detect misspelled words and gives suggestions.
Project 5 is a project wher I use an algorithm to find the quickest path in a given diagraph.
